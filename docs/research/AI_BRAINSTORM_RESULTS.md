**Problem it solves:**
Freelancers can't see whether they can safely take time off, hire help, or make purchases because their view is "today-only" cash, not where cash will be in 30–90 days.

**How it works:**
- User sets forecast window (30/60/90 days)
- Projects daily BNE using current balance + recurring items + optional one-off events
- Shows simple chart + summary ("Earliest cash low on Feb 10: $1,200")

**Freemium:**
- Free: 30-day forecast only, max 3 manual events
- Pro: 60/90-day views, unlimited what-if events, save multiple scenarios

**Score:** 81/100 (User Value: 9, Complexity: 6, Freemium: 9, Strategic: 9)

- User confirms/changes, Solventless learns rules ("Always tag Figma as Software")

**Freemium:**

These utility-style tools are designed to provide immediate value to contractors and freelancers, leveraging existing data or simple user inputs, while adhering strictly to the "no backend database" and "minimum liability" constraints.

### 1. Project Profitability Calculator ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Score:** 72/100 (User Value: 9, Complexity: 3, Freemium: 8, Strategic: 9)

**Problem it solves:**
Contractors often struggle with accurate bidding and understanding if a project is truly worth their time and resources. This tool provides immediate clarity on potential profit margins, helping them make better bidding decisions and avoid unprofitable work.

**How it works:**
- Users input estimated project revenue, material costs, labor hours, hourly rates (for themselves and any team members), and other direct expenses
- Tool calculates estimated gross profit and profit margin for that specific project
- Can pull existing hourly rates or material costs if stored in Solventless

**Freemium hook:**
- Free: Basic calculation with limited input fields (e.g., total revenue, total costs)
- Pro: Detailed breakdown with multiple line items; ability to save and compare multiple project scenarios; integration with existing "Accounts Receivable" for actual project tracking

**Technical feasibility:** Highly feasible. All calculations are client-side based on user input. No new infrastructure needed. It's essentially an advanced calculator.

**Time to ship:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 2. Hourly Rate & Salary Equivalent Calculator ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Score:** 63/100 (User Value: 9, Complexity: 3, Freemium: 7, Strategic: 8)

**Problem it solves:**
Many freelancers underprice their services because they don't account for overhead, taxes, and non-billable hours. This tool provides a realistic hourly rate, ensuring they cover all costs and achieve their desired income.

**How it works:**
- Users input: desired annual income, estimated annual billable hours, estimated non-billable hours, annual overhead expenses, desired profit margin
- Calculator suggests a target hourly rate
- Can work in reverse: input hourly rate to see equivalent annual income

**Freemium hook:**

- Users can add custom materials
- Calculate quantities needed (e.g., "How many 2x4s for 120 linear feet?")

## 🚀 Moonshots (High Effort, Transformative)

### 1. Full Bank Sync (Plaid)
- **Impact:** Puts Solventless closer to QuickBooks/Wave
- **Challenge:** Requires backend, security, ongoing costs
- **Estimated:** 2-3 months + $50-100/month costs
- **⚠️ Liability:** HIGH - Requires secure storage of financial credentials, PCI compliance considerations

### 2. True Multi-User Collaboration
- **Impact:** Live accountant/partner access
- **Challenge:** Auth, roles, real database needed
- **Estimated:** 2-4 months
- **⚠️ Liability:** MEDIUM - Requires data access controls, GDPR/privacy compliance

### 3. Deep Peer Benchmarking
- **Impact:** "How do I compare to similar businesses?"
- **Challenge:** Requires aggregated multi-user data + infra
- **Estimated:** 3+ months
- **⚠️ Liability:** MEDIUM - Handling aggregated financial data, privacy concerns

**Note:** These conflict with "no backend, LocalStorage only" constraint but would strongly differentiate. **They also introduce significant liability due to data handling and external integrations.**
